### Hello World! üëã

:dna: :petri_dish: I'm a Biologist and I have a Ph.D. in Biotechnology, with doctoral research studies focused on comparative genomics and functional analysis. 
In a nutshell, I have a broad experience in the molecular biology area, including: culture of microorganisms, cloning, synthetic biology, sequencing by synthesis and 
bioinformatic analysis of next-generation sequencing data. Thus, I'm also truly passionate about Data...

:woman_technologist: In this way, I have switched my career into Data Science:

  > My Hard skills: Python, Statistics, Data Visualization, Time Series Forecasting and Machine Learning :computer: :snake: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

  > My Soft skills: Intellectual curiosity, Critical thinking, Storytelling, Communication and Teamwork :thought_balloon:
